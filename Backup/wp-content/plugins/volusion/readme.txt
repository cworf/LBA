Integrate the great Volusion hosted ecommerce shopping cart into WordPress.

== Description ==

<h3>Easily link to your Volusion products from within WordPress</h3>

Once the plugin has been configured, you can easily embed product images using the WordPress `Add an Image` button. Adding product images has never been easier! (see the Screenshots section for an example).

<h4>It's easy to embed pictures of your products.</h4>

You want to spend your time writing the best content, not hunting for the link for the product you're blogging about. This plugin is simple to set up, and powerful. If you use WordPress and Volusion, it's a must have.
